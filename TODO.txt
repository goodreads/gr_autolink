* fix the README to use new gem name and change any examples that behave
  differently from original gem
* handle parens better so that we don't take too many in cases like
  (you should take a look at http://www.goodreads.com), in which the
  closing paren is going to be picked up
** probably just keep existing regex and then truncate any closing
   punctuation from the href and just tack it on after the </a>
